## 🎯 Philosophy

NixPen was created to provide a modern, lightweight and reliable screen annotation experience for Linux.

While similar tools exist on other platforms, Linux lacked a simple, polished and actively maintained alternative focused on speed and usability.

NixPen aims to be:
*   Minimal
*   Fast
*   Stable
*   Focused
*   Native to the Linux ecosystem

## � Compatibility

NixPen works on modern Linux distributions including:
*   Ubuntu / Debian-based systems
*   Fedora / RHEL-based systems
*   Arch-based systems
*   KDE Plasma
*   GNOME
*   X11
*   Wayland (via XWayland compatibility layer)

## 📦 Installation (AppImage)

The easiest way to run NixPen on most Linux distributions.

1.  **Download** the latest `NixPen-x86_64.AppImage` from the [Releases](https://github.com/Pipecaldev/nixpen/releases) page.
2.  **Make it executable**:
    ```bash
    chmod +x NixPen-x86_64.AppImage
    ```
3.  **Run**:
    ```bash
    ./NixPen-x86_64.AppImage
    ```

### Optional: System Integration
For better desktop integration (application menu, icons, auto-updates), we recommend using **[AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher)**. It will automatically detect and integrate your AppImages.
